# Simon's Game - An Electronic Memory Challenge

Overview:
Simon's Game is a classic electronic game of memory and reflexes, originally introduced in the late 1970s. This repository hosts a digital recreation of this iconic game, providing users with a nostalgic yet modern experience.

Features:

Intuitive Interface: Four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow) each associated with a unique tone.
Progressive Difficulty: The game starts with a single button/tone sequence and progressively gets more complex.
Adaptive Speed: As players progress, the game increases in speed, offering a greater challenge.
High Score Tracking: Keep track of your best sequences and challenge yourself to improve.
How to Play:

Launch the game and wait for one of the buttons to light up accompanied by its tone.
Click on the button that was lit. If correct, Simon will repeat the sequence and add another random button/tone.
Your task is to reproduce the sequence correctly. The game continues adding longer sequences until a mistake is made or if the response time is too slow.
Aim to replicate sequences for as long as possible, testing and enhancing your memory and reflex skills.
